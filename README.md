### How to build and run:
This is a simple gradle project.
The easiest way to run it would be to open it in intellij:
- Set JDK to 17 (can be downloaded via the IDE)
- gradle is already configured with gradlew

Running the application will start listening to `http://localhost:3000` and validating messages from the github web-hook.
